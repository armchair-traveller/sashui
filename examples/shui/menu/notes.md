It seems from my brief observation that:

- It's just state changes (dispatch, reducers), though there's event handlers too.
- The state changes trigger updates. You'd likely do this with a custom store.
- Key events
- Aria props
- Event handlers
- Request animation frame

... wow these notes were useless. Attempting an initial adaption was far more fruitful. The final implementation looks completely different from initial.
