**S**velte **H**eadless **UI Demo**

âš  Experimental. Nothing works as of yet.

This is just a little Svelte project attempting to adapt Headless-UI's (React) functionality to Svelte. Its end goal is just to have the functionality and accessibility of Headless-UI as a few components with predefined unstyled elements. In the demo form, it'll mostly serve as examples of accessible components for reference, rather than as a library. It won't provide the same wrapper/abstraction API that Headless gives as the Tailwind Labs team will be spearheading that effort when they make their way to Svelte.

Current status: Just creating the base level components: elements, event handlers, and props. No higher-level abstractions like what Headless offers until the base works.

## Relevant Links

[Headless-UI React](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/tree/main/packages/%40headlessui-react/src/components) - for reference and headlessui.dev for API

[renderless-svelte](https://github.com/stephane-vanraes/renderless-svelte/tree/master/src) - for reference

[`svelte:element`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/5481) - could provide `as`-like props.

[Spread events](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/5112) - mentions headless/react-aria. The API for a headless implementation would be much cleaner with spreadable events. Actions have issues due to no SSR.

**Alt**

[Multiple components per file](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2940) - non-issue. It would offer a cleaner API to be able to reference components like `<Menu.Item>` & `<Menu.Items>`, but a similar API could be achieved by using slot props, the only issue being slightly more typing.
